## What is it?
RESTful API server using Node and Express that implements CRUDL operations with extensive validation for 2 json objects (orders and dishes). Generic element validators are built to be called on multiple elements. Also, custom field validators are implemented to support specific json element business rules. 

## Why?
Provide practical application of implementing an Express server that serves up REST API methods using JSON object, and nested array/object data structures. 

## My Focus
The focus on this exercise was to build-out the create, read, update, delete and list functions. Front-end capabilities are omitted as 
this exercise is focused on back-end development.  

## Where Can I See It?
I hope to publish a link soon.
