# GrubDash

## What is it?
Advanced React software application to demonstrate hooks, events, side-effects, routing, navigation, state, single responsibility and asynchronous RESTful API calls with Bootstrap styling. 

## Why?
Provide practical application of real-world React application techniques that are required to support a one-to-many data model using REST, with an interactive study page that allows front and back view of flash cards, in additional to all CRUD capability for Decks and Cards.

## My Focus
The focus on this exercise was to build out a fully-functional React application from scratch to support essential Flash card application features with database connectivity. 

## Where Can I See It?
This is still a work-in-progress. But, I hope to publish a link soon.
